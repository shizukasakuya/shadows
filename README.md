# Shadow Tendril Game

## An Interactive Exploration of Rumination

This project is a web-based interactive experience exploring rumination through visual metaphors. Built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript in collaboration with claude (anthropic).

## Overview

- Canvas-based animation with shadow-like tendrils responding to cursor movements
- Gradual darkening effect as tendrils encircle the cursor
- Dynamic appearance of positive and negative thoughts
- Transition effects between light and dark states

## Purpose

Visualize how thoughts can spiral during rumination and the potential for breaking free from negative thought patterns. A need to stay in motion. This helped me to express my own rumination through interaction.

## How to Use

1. `npm install && npm start` in a web browser
