## how to run

npm install

npm run server
npm start

## other dependencies

Note for the server you need python3, opencv-python, and numpy.

This is needed to cute the sprite out and trim it down for game rendering.

### .env

you need an .env file at the root of your directory with your openAI token.
OPENAI_API_KEY=123

Server needs this call dalle and chat gpt.. its pretty cheap though !!
